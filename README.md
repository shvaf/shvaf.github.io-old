## Current Projects
### Analysis of Severe Maternal Morbidity Using OHSU Health Records
â€¢	Analyzed and cleaned electronic health records associated with 15,000 birth records to build a cohort of 192 patients who had experienced severe post-partum morbidities 

â€¢	Identified that 15% of the patients with severe maternal morbidities experienced them in late post-partum indicating a high prevalence of maternal morbidities in an under-researched time frame

### Determining a Biological Pattern to Frailty using the MrOS Cohort	with R
â€¢	Created an ordinal regression model in R that evaluated the protein panels for 485 elderly patients to determine if there is a biological pattern to frailty 

â€¢	Out of the 7000+ proteins that were analyzed using machine learning methods such as random forest, 62 proteins were highly relevant predictors of overall frailty
