## Current Projects
### Analysis of Severe Maternal Morbidity Using OHSU Health Records
â€¢	Analyzed and cleaned electronic health records associated with 15,000 birth records to build a cohort of 192 patients who had experienced severe post-partum morbidities 

â€¢	Identified that 15% of the patients with severe maternal morbidities experienced them in late post-partum indicating a high prevalence of maternal morbidities in an under-researched time frame

### Determining a Biological Pattern to Frailty using the MrOS Cohort	with R
â€¢	Created an ordinal regression model in R that evaluated the protein panels for 485 elderly patients to determine if there is a biological pattern to frailty 

â€¢	Out of the 7000+ proteins that were analyzed using machine learning methods such as random forest, 62 proteins were highly relevant predictors of overall frailty

### Optimization of Coffee Selection by Rating and Budget using R
â€¢	Cleaned real-world data, filtered a dataset, visualized it using tables and figures, and analyzed it to optimize coffee quality and budget using R

â€¢	The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and evaluated to determine a comparable cost for 1600+ coffees and optimize coffee selection based on cost and quality

## Work Experience
### Intern â€“ Biostatistics Shared Resource Core 					
Oct 2023 â€“ Jun 2024
OHSU Knight Cancer Research Institute, Portland, OR				
â€¢	Developed a high-accuracy Python text mining program for diagnosing DVT from radiology reports, achieving 98% accuracy across a dataset of 4,300 records.
â€¢	Analyzed overall survival for patients with high-risk myelofibrosis treated with donor stem cells and determined that graft-versus-host-disease significantly decreased median survival time
â€¢	Collaborated with biostatisticians to analyze cancer-related clinical trial data and build predictive models using regression models in R, enhancing the reliability of clinical insights for cancer patient care.
â€¢	Optimized R scripts for electronic data capture, supporting real-time analysis of cancer care data.

### Teaching Assistant									
Jan 2024 â€“ Mar 2024
OHSU-PSU School of Public Health, Portland, OR					
â€¢	Mentored students and conducted bi-weekly office hours to offer targeted programming assistance, enhancing their proficiency in R

### Protein Chemist III â€“ Quality Control Lab Manager					Mar 2021 â€“ Apr 2022
### Protein Chemist II â€“ Quality Control Lab Manager					Apr 2019 â€“ Mar 2021 
### Quality Control Analyst								Mar 2017 â€“ Apr 2019
NextCure, Beltsville, MD	
â€¢	Led project management for clinical manufacturing of six oncology drug product lots, ensuring compliance with GMP and collaborating with cross-functional teams on timelines, sample management, and reporting.
â€¢	Authored and maintained technical documentation supporting clinical trials, including stability, safety, and characterization reports for three cancer therapeutics, supporting regulatory submissions.
â€¢	Managed automation and optimization projects for laboratory processes, including automated temperature control and equipment integration, to improve data reliability and analysis accuracy.
